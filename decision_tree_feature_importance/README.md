## feature importance from decision trees

This is where we figured out how to to extract feature importance from the data using decision trees. Included are:

1. *dt.sbt*: the scala sbt package file
2. *src/main/scala/decision_tree.scala*: the file that created the tree and extracted feature importance
3. *run.py*: the python script we used to run the decision tree on all the timesteps.
4. *run1, run2, run3*: the results from 3 runs of the code
